# cplib by cuzperf

C++17 template for competitive programming contest, which contains numerous math algorithms.

- Aims: build a stable, fast, easy-to-read C++ template (the more you use it, the more reliable it is)
- Build: You can use head-only version or build version using [standalone_gn](https://agora-adc-artifacts.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/standalone_gn_latest.zip) which based on [gn](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/)  and [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- Test: All algorithms are tested in [LuoGu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and github CI/CD are enabled
- Document: leave many comments in the code, unit_test and smoke_test are also a kind of document, and [introduction](https://cuzperf.github.io/cplib) using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Reference: [CP-algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/), [AtCoder](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library) and many awesome blogs, for instance [zscoder](https://codeforces.com/profile/zscoder) posted in codeforces and [jiangly's submissions](https://codeforces.com/submissions/jiangly)
- Reference(Chinese): [OI-wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/) and [LuoGu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/)

> Sorry, it's really hard to for me to give a reference for every algorithm.
